# Welcome to my portfolio website!

![A picture of me at UC Berkeley](/1547204353970.jfif)

My name is Yeh Chan Yoo, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley! I am both a resident and a citizen of South Korea. I am a declared Statistics and Political Economy major and also am minoring in Data Science! I am set to be graduating on December 2023.

This website was built to host some of the research work I made during my time in the last several years; I sincerely hope that you do enjoy reading and interacting with my work!

(The work I have below are arranged by date of creation from most recent to least recent.)

## [Transit and Housing in California](https://deepnote.com/@berkeley-datathon-fall-2022-project/Presentation-3aa74663-1377-4af5-9f38-92009ab3c36b) 

This article was made within 3 days for the Fall 2022 UC Berkeley Datathon and won second place in Urban Studies track. For this article, my Datathon team (consisting of [Gain Boonavich](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gainsira/), Anita Ding, [Yixin Huang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yixin-huang-91b7781aa/), and myself) used Python to perform linear regression and create data visualizations in order to dive into the relationship between the amount of investment in transit and the number of housing units in Californian counties.

## [SAAS x Trace Data](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12Q5RciThBbhEOnpQ-6ASKT7Fe_ZnnH4NoDMHMqB73cE/edit?usp=sharing)

During the Fall 2019 semester, as a member of the Data Consulting committee in Student Association for Applied Statistics (SAAS), I worked in a team to create our own json key-value pair classification systems using machine learning and natural language processing models with data provided by startup named Trace Data (later acquired by [Netskope](https://www.netskope.com/)). More specifically, I worked with [Amal Bhatnagar](https://www.linkedin.com/in/amal-bhatnagar/) to create an unsupervised clustering algorithm using tf-idf as the main metric.

## [Meaning of Probabilities in Social Sciences](/susa_research_yy_fall_2018.html)

As a declared Statistics major interested in social sciences, I often found that probability was used a lot in social science research. But I often wondered: *what do these probabilities fundamentally mean?* I wrote an article on the meaning of probabilities in social sciences to help answer this question during my time as a member of the Research and Publication Committee in Statistics Undergraduate Student Association (now called SAAS or Student Association for Applied Statistics).

## [Analyzing Undergraduate Statistics Majors’ Preparation in Communication with Non-Statisticians in the University of California, Berkeley](/statistics_communication_paper/Yoo_Yehchan_Spring2018_CompleteResearchPaper.pdf)

Writing statistical reports for non-statisticians is a crucial part of a statistician’s job, so it is critical for undergraduate statistics courses to prepare statistics majors for such communication with non-statisticians. To check how much preparation the undergraduate statistics majors were receiving in statistical writing for non-statisticians in University of California, Berkeley, I surveyed members of the Statistics Undergraduate Student Association, gave an online questionnaire to a graduate statistics student who was an undergraduate statistics major in the university, and interviewed two statistics professors. The survey, the questionnaire, and the interviews indicated that -- while undergraduate statistics majors did receive a lot of training in statistical writing in their undergraduate statistics major classes -- they did not get much practice doing statistical writing with non-statisticians as their general audience from the classes. While the interviews indicated that the Department of Statistics was hesitant to enforce stricter writing requirements for statisticians due to a lack of resources and a desire to attract more students into the department’s programs, there overall still existed a need for the department to devote more resources to statistical writing education.

## [Is there a statistical relationship between a region’s legalization of euthanasia and that region’s suicide rate?](https://saas.berkeley.edu/rp/suicide)

Statistical analysis on data from Mexico indicates that the legalization of passive euthanasia in certain Mexican regions likely is unrelated to the Mexican regions’ raw suicide rates in the short run. Difference-in-difference analysis on data from the Netherlands (and Norway) indicates that, while major events towards the legalization of active and passive euthanasia may have had a decreasing short-run impact on the raw suicide rate of the Netherlands, such effect -- if present -- likely became diluted over time.

## [Philosophy of Human Rights](/philosophy_of_human_rights/philosophy_of_human_rights.pptx)

This presentation was created to teach members of Amnesty International at Berkeley about the philosophical meaning and questions behind the concept of human rights during my time in the organization.

## [Focicle2020's Fun Proof-O-Pedia](https://www.geogebra.org/material/show/id/zYqyyRXD)

In this GeoGebra book, I have gathered up the GeoGebra applets I made in my free time to help others understand the workings of certain mathematical concepts and -- most importantly -- to teach them to have fun with math! I hope that people will enjoy my GeoGebra applets!

This collection of personally made interactive GeoGebra templates contains demonstrations for finding the area of a circle, proving the Pythagorean Theorem, proving Power of a Point, etc.
