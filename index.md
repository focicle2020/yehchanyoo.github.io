# Welcome to my official website!

My name is Yehchan Yoo, and I am an undergraduate student at the University of California, Berkeley! I am both a resident and a citizen of South Korea. I am a declared Statistics and Political Economy major and also am minoring in Data Science! I am set to be graduating on December 2023.

This website was built to host some of the cool stuff I wrote and made during my time in the university; I sincerely hope that you do enjoy reading/interacting with my stuff!
